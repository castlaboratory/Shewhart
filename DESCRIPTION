Description: Provides a streamlined workflow for detecting and modeling process phase changes using Shewhart control charts. It features tools for fitting common transformations (log, log-log, Gompertz), identifying phases via the “7 consecutive points” rule, and computing control limits on both transformed and original scales. The package leverages the tidyverse for intuitive data manipulation and is designed to be easily integrated into broader data analysis pipelines.
