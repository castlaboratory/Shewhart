\title{Rolling sum function with a 7-point window}
\usage{
rolling_sum(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}, where each element
  is the sum of the last 7 (or fewer) elements, including the current one.
}
\description{
This function uses [slider::slide_dbl()] from the **slider** package to create
a rolling sum with a window size of 7. It treats `NA` values as zero via
[tidyr::replace_na()].
}
\details{
The function slides over the input \code{x} with a window of size 7,
summing the available values. At the beginning of the vector (where fewer than
7 elements exist), it sums however many elements are present. This avoids
discarding data at the edges.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 library(slider)
 x <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
 rolling_sum(x)
}
